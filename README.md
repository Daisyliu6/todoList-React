### simple React To Do list 
 * map, filter methods are useful to simplify the code
 * separate the code into 3 components the main App component, the TodoItem component and the InputArea component
 * Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
 * A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.
 * Can use a Hook inside the existing function component
